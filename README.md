# EasyDocs

Other online text editors require some sort of account relative to their platform for eg: google account for using google docs. Easy Docs text editor intends to solve that problem without compromising on important features, to name a few, like version control, collaborating with other people and downloading as a pdf file etc.

Easy Docs is powered by react on the frontend and java in the backend with java servlets.
